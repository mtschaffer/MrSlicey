This is a team fun project where we start with a simple 2d game scaffolding and see where it ends up.  On your turn you must add a single feature that make the game "more fun".  This must be worked on in your free time as not to affect your normal job duties.  Please watch the progress and plan your turn so your contribution will be speedy so you can pass it on to the next dev.
